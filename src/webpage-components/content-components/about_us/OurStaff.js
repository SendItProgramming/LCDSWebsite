        <p>I was born and raised here in Edmonton.
        I grew up in the north side of Edmonton and now currently live on the south side with my husband Neil and my cat and dog. I have two degrees.
        My first degree is in Psychology with a minor in Sociology. My second degree is in Elementary Education.
        I have worked with children in a various number of places such as the womenâ€™s shelter, YMCA day cares and have taught in a couple of Head Start programs.
        One of my hobbies is singing. I have sung in a mixed community choir for 6 years. 
        Your children will learn many new songs and dances.
        I really love working with children and families.
        I love seeing the growth and development of all children.</p>
